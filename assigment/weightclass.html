  <h2>The importance of weight-classes in MMA</h2>
  <p>Weight classes in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) are divisions of fighters based on their weight, 
    which ensures that fighters compete against others of similar size and weight. This is important for 
    safety reasons and to create a level playing field for all fighters
  <dl>
    <dt>Safety</dt><dd> --MMA is a physically demanding sport that involves a high level
       of physical contact, and fighters who are significantly different in 
       weight and size can pose a safety risk to each other. By separating 
       fighters into weight classes, the risk of injury due to uneven matches 
       is reduced.</dd>
    <dt>Fairness</dt><dd>--Fighters of similar size and weight are more likely to 
      have similar physical abilities, making for a more even playing field.
       Without weight classes, larger fighters would have a significant advantage
        over smaller fighters, which could make the sport less competitive and 
        less fair.</dd> 
   <dt>Strategy</dt><dd>--Weight classes can also create a strategic element to the sport.
     Fighters must decide which weight class to compete in based on their own 
     size and abilities, as well as their opponents. This decision can impact 
     the fighterâ€™s training, diet, and overall strategy for the fight.</dd>
